# Parcimonie

With our school, INSA Rennes, we have a project on the parcimonie.
We have to create a report on an article. We have to read it, explore it and
comput some algorithm that we can find on it.

We have chosen [this on](https://github.com/Macerio/Projet_Parcimonie/blob/master/Yang%2010%20-%20T%20IP%20-%20sparse%20SR.pdf)

In this github, we collect our python notebook that we computed on this article.
